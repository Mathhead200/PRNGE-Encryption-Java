# PRNGE-Encryption-Java

Author: I don't remember what the differences between the newer 2013 and
the older normal version are, but he main classes seam to be the same in both:

(Graphical User Interface version)
Main Class: com.mathhead200.prnge.PrngeGUI

(Text User Interface version, i.e. console version)
Main Class: com.mathhead200.prnge.PrngeTUI
